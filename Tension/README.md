> This `README.md` file is used for project describtion

## Introduction

This project was made 3/10/2021 (EU date) as my e-learning project

I chosed for this project local DJ/music group as a customer, because they:
1. Did not have any website
2. DJ is my friend

## Process

I composed process into a few steps:

- 1st step: Consultation - I skipped this one because it is my private project
- 2nd step: Graphic design - made in [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/photoshop.html)
- 3th step (in progress): Code creating - Website is made by [Vanilla](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20836115/what-does-vanilla-mean) website technique
- 4th step (not done yet): Validation check & Bug fixing - due to webdesign standards

In this case I tried to focus on work with:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons
