> This `README.md` file is used for project describtion

## Introduction

This project was made 3/10/2021 (EU date) as my e-learning project

I chosed for this project local DJ/music group as a customer, because they:
1. Did not have any website
2. DJ is my friend

Result of this project should be: 
- Fully responsive website based on design without advanced functions

## Process

I composed process into a few steps:

- 1st step: Consultation - I skipped this one because it is my private project
- 2nd step: Graphic design - made first in [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/photoshop.html) and second in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/xd.html)
- 3rd step: Custom icons - made in [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/illustrator.html)
- 4th step: Code creating - Website is made by [Vanilla](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20836115/what-does-vanilla-mean) website technique
- 5th step: Validation check & Bug fix - due to standards ([HTML5](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)), image [compression](https://imagecompressor.com/)

In this case I tried to focus on work with:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework

## Result

Website prepared: 1) to edit with PHP language, 2) to use as a theme for [WordPress](https://cs.wordpress.org/)
