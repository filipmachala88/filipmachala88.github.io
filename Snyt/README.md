> This `README.md` file is used for project describtion

## Introduction

This project was made 26/4/2021 (EU date) as Graduation Thesis in 4th class of High School but presented 16/6/2021 and it should represent my knowledge of this problematic at this time

I chosed for this project local restaurant as a customer, because they:
1. Didnt have any website
2. I had there my Summer School Practice (helping with social sites) so the problematic was a bit familiar to me which helped me while process

## Process

I composed process into a few steps:

- 1st step: Consultation - I skipped this one due to world pandemic situation (explaining is not important)
- 2nd step: [Wireframe](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/wireframing.html)
- 3rd step: Graphic design - in this step I also made a few icons in [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/illustrator.html) and banners in [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/cz/products/photoshop.html)
- 4th step: Code creating - Website is made by [Vanilla](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20836115/what-does-vanilla-mean) website technique
- 5th step: Validation check & Bug fixing - due to webdesign standards

In this case I tried to focus on work with:
- Single file [font-family](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp) which were free to use
- Icons as single `.svg` file (without export)

## Result

Full properly working responsive website prepared to place on web server

Page benefits:
- Responsive webpage will be good looking in every device
- Original webpapge shouldnt be endangered by copyright
- Simple light code webpage doesnt slow server
- Good looking code can be easly used or edited by another web developer

Page negatives:
- Page is created only for presentation purpose not for marketing purpose
- Page does not have database so text is hardly possible to change
