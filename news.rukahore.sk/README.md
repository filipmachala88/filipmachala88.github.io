## Introduction

This project is created for my personal web-skills development. It will never be used as product to sell.

I composed process into a few steps:

- 1st step (in progress): Code creating - Website is made by [Vanilla](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20836115/what-does-vanilla-mean) website technique
- 2nd step (not done yet): Validation check & Bug fixing - due to webdesign standards

<!-- 
## Result

Page benefits:
- Responsive webpage will be good looking in every device

Page negatives:
- Page is created only for presentation purpose not for marketing purpose
